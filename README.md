# SVM_Classif
Linear SVM classifier

1)The code opens an image and shows the training examples of both classes. The points of one class are represented with white circles and black ones are used for the other class.
2)The SVM is trained and used to classify all the pixels of the image. This results in a division of the image in a blue region and a green region. The boundary between both regions is the optimal separating hyperplane.
3)Finally the support vectors are shown using gray rings around the training examples.
