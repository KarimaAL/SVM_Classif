A. Basics
1) Initialize the training examples (points) in an image.

2)The SVM is trained and used to classify all the pixels of the image. 

3)Finally the support vectors are shown around the training examples.

B. Handwritten digits:
-Handwritten digit classifier using OpenCV and c++.
-Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is used for extracting features from images.
